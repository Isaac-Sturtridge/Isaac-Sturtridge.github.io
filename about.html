        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Aspiring programmer and coder. Always had an interest in computers from a very young age.
            Aiming to move into a software development role.
            I have degrees in history & international relations, have a lot of interest in data analysis and creating new things.
            I'd call myself well-rounded and a fast learner. There's nothing within the realm of software and IT I wouldn't mind learning more about. Many things outside of that too.
            Welcome to my page. This is where I will show off my projects from all forms of computer science.
