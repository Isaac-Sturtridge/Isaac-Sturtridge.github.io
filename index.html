            <img src="profilephoto.jpg" alt="A picture of me, Isaac Sturtridge">
            <p>I'm a details-oriented programmer and coder. I've always had an interest in computers from a very young age and I've supplemented that with a great track record of learning in the last few years.</p>

            <p>  I'm taking up the challenge to change careers into software development. I've spent the last few months on an intense bootcamp at Northcoders learning everything about the industry.</p>
             <p> A bit of background: I have degrees in history & international relations, I'm interested in the creative side of software development and analysing data.</p> 
               <p>I'm very keen to learn and get experience with all kinds of new technology.</p><p>
                Welcome to my page. This is where I will host my projects. Please click on the portfolio link to see them.</p>

                <h3>Bowling Teams</h3>
                <p>A calculator that can be fed bowling averages. It will then output equal teams for the purpose of fairly dividing players. This came from
                    my attendance at a bowling club, where we'd spend a while each night figuring out fair teams as averages would change each week, as would those in attendance.
                    It was a great hit among my friends at the bowling group and saved us lots of time each week.
                    Uses Javascript*, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS.
