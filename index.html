            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Aspiring programmer and coder. Always had an interest in computers from a very young age.
                Aiming to move into a software development role.
                I have degrees in history & international relations, have a lot of interest in data analysis and creating new things.
                I'd call myself well-rounded and a fast learner. There's nothing within the realm of software and IT I wouldn't like to learn more about. Many things outside of that too.
                Welcome to my page. This is where I will show off my projects from all forms of computer science. 
            </p>

                <h3>Bowling Teams</h3>
                <p>A calculator that can be fed bowling averages. It will then output equal teams for the purpose of fairly dividing players. This came from
                    my attendance at a bowling club, where we'd spend a while each night figuring out fair teams as averages would change each week, as would those in attendance.
                    It was a great hit among my friends at the bowling group and saved us lots of time each week.
                    Uses Javascript*, Bootstrap, HTML/CSS.
